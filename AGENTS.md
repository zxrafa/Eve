## Game bug reports

Users report game bugs with Eve logs (`eden_log.txt`, `eden_log.txt.old`). Each `Booting game: <program id>` line starts a session; the build is on the first line (`Eve Version: ... | nx2-<sha>`). Known program ids:

| Program id | Game |

## Before writing a fix

Eve is a fork of [Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine). Do not guess, and do not rewrite a fix upstream already has.

1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine.git && git fetch upstream`.
2. Check `upstream/nx2`, open and closed PRs, unmerged branches, and issues for the game and symptom (`gh pr list -R Djihads80/Eglantine --state all`, `gh issue list -R Djihads80/Eglantine --state all`, `gh pr diff <n>`). Read the diffs, not only the titles.
3. If nx2 is behind `upstream/nx2`, merge upstream first. Port an existing upstream fix before writing a new one, and cite its PR or commit.
4. Write a new fix only when nothing upstream addresses the root cause the log shows.

## Live debug server

Every debug package on the PC launches with `EDEN_NX2_DEBUG_SERVER=127.0.0.1:6545` (in the env argument of `build-fix.sh`; `EDEN_NX2_DEBUG_DIR=<dir>` moves its dumps). Ask the running game from bash on the PC with native Windows Python; MSYS `python` rejects `C:/` paths.

```sh
PY=/c/Users/Zortos/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python314/python.exe
$PY -I C:/lx/src/tools/nx2/debug_mcp.py --server 127.0.0.1:6545 --call '{"method":"status"}'
$PY -I C:/lx/src/tools/nx2/debug_mcp.py --server 127.0.0.1:6545 --call '{"method":"screenshot"}' --out C:/Users/Zortos/.capy/work/eve-debug/shot.png
```

Methods: `status`, `screenshot`, `log_tail` (`after`, `contains`), `log_filter`, `capture_frame` (the frame dump below, taken now; `sampled`, `index`), `capture_image`, `reject_shaders` (`EDEN_NX2_REJECT_HASH` at runtime; `"reject": false` restores). Without `--call` the script is a stdio MCP server. See `docs/nx2/debug-mcp.md`.

- Try a live experiment (screenshot, `reject_shaders` A/B, `capture_frame`, `log_tail`) before asking the owner for a new build or shortcut.
- Use full 16-hex-digit hashes; shorter ones are refused.
- Restore every hash you reject before you finish.
- Never start or stop the emulator. If nothing listens, ask the owner to launch the game.
- Keep sessions light while the owner plays: one request at a time, no capture loops, `sampled` only when you need pass inputs.

## RenderDoc and the live server

Use both for graphics investigations. The live server provides emulator state, native shader hashes, logs and reversible shader A/B tests. [RenderDoc](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc) inspects the translated Vulkan frame: draw and dispatch state, resource contents, pixel history and shader debugging where supported. Prefer it over extending our dumps when it already exposes the missing evidence.

- Use the live server to identify the failing scene and programs, then capture one affected frame with RenderDoc. Find the first incorrect output and inspect its inputs, bindings, blend/depth state and resource dependencies. Record the build, settings, event IDs and shader hashes so the two views can be correlated.
- The existing integration is `src/core/tools/renderdoc.cpp`, gated by `enable_renderdoc_hotkey`. It requires RenderDoc to be loaded into the process; enabling the hotkey alone does not load it. Ask the owner to launch the capture-enabled package. Never start, stop or inject into their running emulator without their approval.
- [renderdoc-mcp](https://github.com/Linkingooo/renderdoc-mcp) is a third-party replay adapter, not part of RenderDoc. Pin and inspect its version, use a compatible RenderDoc Python module, and verify a real capture opens before relying on it. If an extension, pixel-history query or shader debug operation is unsupported, report that limit rather than treating missing data as a clean result.
- Keep `.rdc` captures on the owner's PC: they can contain game shaders, textures and buffers. Do not upload them to public issues or services. Share only the specific permitted evidence needed for the investigation.
- Capture and replay can alter timing or hide races. Compare with an uncaptured live run before ruling out a synchronization bug. Distinguish measured GPU counters from adapter estimates; use CPU/thread and frame traces for emulator performance.
- A shader replacement that reduces fog or exposure can be a useful visual comparison, but is not proof of an emulator fix. Trace the original pipeline's first incorrect result before shipping a change. Matching shader arithmetic alone does not validate bindings, synchronization or input data.

## Debugging tools

Use these before guessing. All are off unless the variable is set; pass them as the env argument of `build-fix.sh`. Read them from the log at `*:Info` unless noted.

| Symptom | Tool | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong image (white, black, missing objects, smearing) | `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP=<dir>` with `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP_AT=<seconds>`, `<frame>f` or `file` (captures once `<dir>/capture.now` exists; default 60); add `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP_SAMPLED=1` for pass inputs | One frame's pass colour targets, dispatch storage images (3D included) and present source; with `_SAMPLED`, every texture each pass samples and each compute shader samples before its first dispatch (`kind: sampled`, with stage (5 = compute), TIC index, host sampler state and raw TSC words, 3D and depth included, block-compressed as raw blocks without a `.png`), the uniform and storage buffers of every draw and dispatch once per shader and binding (`kind: buffer`, bytes in `buffer_<hash>.bin.zst`, from the host buffer when the GPU wrote the range) each dispatch's group counts (`kind: launch`) every draw or dispatch dropped for a rejected program (`kind: skipped`, with program address, rt0 and reason) and the samples each draw passed (`kind: draw`, from an occlusion query, with mesh and indirect flags, first element, element and instance counts; draws made while the game counts samples are not probed), as `.png` and `.raw.zst`, plus `manifest.jsonl` with shader hashes, formats, addresses and per-channel stats. `python3 -I tools/nx2/frame_dump_index.py <dir>` builds `index.html`. Find the first pass whose output is wrong, then inspect its shaders. |
| Flashes or flicker lasting 1-2 frames | `EDEN_NX2_FLASH_WATCH=<dir>`; `EDEN_NX2_FLASH_WATCH_PASSES=0` watches only the presented image. Thresholds: `_RATIO` (1.5) and `_DELTA` (0.15) for presented tiles, `_PASS_RATIO` (2) for outputs, `_HOT` (1024) for hot texels, `_MAX` (10) reports | Every frame, each pass colour target, dispatch image and presented image is reduced on the GPU to 32x18 tiles (mean, peak, NaN/Inf texels, hot texels). A presented tile brighter than in both frames before it and in one of the two after logs `Flash watch: frame N ...` at Warning with the first output that was abnormal in the flashed region, and writes `flash_<frame>.jsonl` and `.tiles` comparing every output of frames N-2..N+2. `python3 -I tools/nx2/flash_report.py <dir>` builds an HTML page per report. Then dump and compare the culprit pass's shaders. |
| Rejected or miscompiled shaders | `EDEN_NX2_SHADER_DUMP=<dir>` | Native programs with `.header.bin` sidecars and `failed-compute-*.env` for failed compute pipelines. Replay offline with `tools/nx2/shader_sweep.py` (see `tools/nx2/shader-sweep.md`). |
| A newly lowered program changes the image | `EDEN_NX2_REJECT_HASH=<hash>,...` (native program keys from shader dump file names, or shader hashes from the frame dump) | Those programs are rejected as if unsupported; the log shows `rejected by EDEN_NX2_REJECT_HASH` per hit. Bisect by halving the list. The key covers the captured code, so recompute it when the capture rules change. |
| Draw and render-state questions | `EDEN_NX2_RENDER_TRACE=1`, filter `*:Info HW.GPU:Debug Render.Vulkan:Debug Shader:Debug` | Per-draw state, rejected stages and zero-format texture descriptors. |
| Video playback | `EDEN_NX2_VDEC_TRACE=1`, `EDEN_NX2_VDEC_DUMP=<dir>` | Decoder submit, decode and composite trace; decoded frames. |
| Performance and frame pacing | `EDEN_NX2_GPU_PROFILE=1`, `EDEN_DKB_FRAME_TRACE=1` | GPU thread time per second by zone; per-present interval, CPU and fence timing. |
| Which functions a thread spends its time in (Windows) | `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_PROFILE=<hz>` with `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_DELAY=<s>`, `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_SECONDS=<s>` (default 20), `EDEN_NX2_SAMPLE_THREADS` (default `GPU,GPUBack,VulkanWorker`; `CPUCore_*` adds the guest cores) | `nx2_samples_<pid>.bin` in the log directory. `python3 -I tools/nx2/sample_report.py <file> --exe eve.exe [--svg out.svg]` prints self and inclusive time by function and the top call paths per thread (eve.pdb next to the exe). Turns the GPU_PROFILE zone timers off. |
| Command corruption or pop-in | `EDEN_NX2_PB_CHECK=1`; A/B with `EDEN_NX2_PB_SNAPSHOT=0` or `EDEN_NX2_FETCH_DRAIN=1` | How many pushbuffer entries change between submit and parse. |
| Wrong instance or material data behind pointer tables (white flicker, missing foliage) | `EDEN_NX2_TABLE_POINTER_TRACE=1` | Each change of a table pointer binding's entry or bound size, per stage and slot, with whether the entry was GPU-written or CPU-written and not yet uploaded when it was bound. |
| Stale buffer data after guest CPU writes (one-frame flashes, a pass reading last frame's values) | `EDEN_NX2_PENDING_WRITE_TRACE=1` | Each draw or dispatch that binds a uniform or storage range holding guest CPU writes that are collected but not yet applied to the host buffer (they apply at fences and cache invalidations): frame, shader hash, stage, binding, GPU and device address, size. |
| Split GPU thread races | `EDEN_NX2_SPLIT_CHECK=1` | Reports scheduler use from the wrong thread. |
| Upscaler and DLSS contracts | `EDEN_NX2_DLSS_CONTRACT_TRACE=1` | Inputs and outputs of replaced upscaler networks. |
| Service calls | `EDEN_NX2_IPC_TRACE=1` | IPC command trace. |
| Host crash (log just stops) | Windows minidump in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps\eve.exe.<pid>.dmp` | Read the exception and stack with the `minidump` Python package, then symbolize with `llvm-symbolizer --obj=eve.exe --inlines --relative-address <offset>` next to the build's `eve.pdb`. |

## How work is split

- One subagent per game, all running in parallel.
- Small research (upstream PR and issue surveys, log reading): a cheap model, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash at max reasoning when its endpoint is available.
- Hard fixes (emulation, shaders, GPU): GPT-6 Astra at high reasoning.
- When a GPT-6 Astra subagent can't find the cause, switch that subagent to Claude Opus 5.5 at high reasoning.
- The main thread (Opus) orchestrates and reviews.

## Builds

- Cloud machines build with clang and Ninja for compile and unit-test checks.
- The build the owner tests runs on the owner's Windows PC (DESKTOP-4UD89UT, Ryzen 9 5900X), built with clang using 12 jobs (`cmake --build <dir> --parallel 12`).
- On the PC the toolchain is clang-cl (LLVM 22) with the VS 2022 SDK, Qt 6.8.3 in `C:/lx/qt`, Ninja and sccache. Source is `C:/lx/src`, the persistent build dir is `C:/lx/build`, and `C:/lx/configure.sh` holds the configure flags. Build and package a fix with one command: `bash C:/lx/build-fix.sh <branch> <build-name> "<Game> - <fix>" ["ENV=VAL ..."] ["log filter"]`.
- Every fix gets its own debug build on that PC in `C:\Users\Zortos\.capy\work\eve-debug\<build>\` and a desktop shortcut `Eve Debug - <Game> - <fix>` that launches it with the owner's existing user data and keeps the log next to the build, so the owner can run it and send the log back.
